# ZoomCal

This project uses the Google Calendar API with the Zoom desktop application to automatically log me into the Zoom meetings that correspond with the class period events on my Google Calendar.

The information regarding the class periods (eg. 2,4,7) and the meeting id and password for each one is all stored in the data.csv file.
